I am proud to announce that Gamemaker Cookbook Jam #5 has been released!

For those who aren't familiar with Cookbook Jams, it's a series of FOSS-focused jams where you can turn your unfinished tools and libraries into released FOSS resources, for a chill and fun time! There is no strict rules other than that the library or tool itself should be at maximum an unfinished released resource. 

To celebrate our fifth jam series, I've gone ahead and compiled a new page of all of the past and current jams, along with their entries. You can find it at the top of the menu under "Cookbooks", or by clicking [here](../../cookbooks). 

The jam starts on the __8th of September 12AM AEST / 7th of September 9AM EST / 7th of September 2PM BST__, and ends on __8th of October 12AM AEST / 7th of October 9AM EST / 7th of October 2PM BST__. You can check out the jam, the FAQ and rules on submission from [here](https://itch.io/jam/cookbook-jam-5).
