An extension for using menus in GM games! That includes:

- Popup/context menus
- Menu bars
- System menus (shown when right-clicking window caption)

The extension wraps almost entirety of Windows' [Menu API](<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/menurc/menus>) so you can have things like

- Buttons
- Separators
- Checkboxes
- Radio buttons
- Sub-menus
- Custom bitmaps
- Size/position measurement and other utilities

The extension is fairly easy to use (make a menu, add items, show/assign menu) and thoroughly documented.

Also doing a little launch sale for the next few days
