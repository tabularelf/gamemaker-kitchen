Bulb is a 2D lighting solution designed for ease-of-use and speed. Shadows are cast by defined geometric shapes with "edges". Point lights, conical (shaped) lights, and directional (sunlight) lights are supported and can be accumulated using either additive or "bm_max" blend modes. Shadows can be hard shadows or a fast approximation of soft shadows that doesn't use any blurring.
