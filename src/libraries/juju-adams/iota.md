iota is a teeny tiny [fixed timestep](https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/) library that handles different framerates automatically for you. You can also set up time dilation for slowmo effects. Multiple "clocks" can run at the same time allowing you to pause different parts of your game easily.
