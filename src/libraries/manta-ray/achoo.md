**Achoo!** is a basic achievements and stats library for Gamemaker.

[Download the latest version](https://matix.li/99186f51c87b) directly, or [visit the itch.io page](https://manta-ray.itch.io/achoo) for more info.


**Achoo!** has the following features:

* Independent GML library - no need to depend on Steam or hosted services to run achievements
* Simple, straightforward, non bloated
* Set up achievements in one line of code!
* Persist your achievements on file, or even store on/retrieve them from your remote server!
* Handle and persist game stats and use them for more complex achievements (e.g. total zombies killed, total runs...).  Storage is encrypted by default to prevent user tinkering.
* Set up hidden achievements and even locked achievements - with a separate unlocking condition!
* Non-forcing UI - you have total control (and responsibility) over what to do / how to render achievement popups  or actions
* Full documentation with examples and tutorial video
* Cross-platform - pure GML, tested in Windows/HTML/Linux
* Free and open source (FOSS) (MIT)
