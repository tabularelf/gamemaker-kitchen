**gooey** is a small UI library that lets you create menus, HUD and other UI elements in Gamemaker 2023+, with a few lines of code, using sprites.

[Download the latest version](https://cdn.matix-media.net/dd/17921ac4) directly, or [visit the itch.io page](https://manta-ray.itch.io/gooey) for more info.


**gooey** has the following features:

* Drag and drop setup - Import the YYMPS and start building!
* Sprite-based - all widgets work with nine-sliced sprites directly within Gamemaker
* Intuitive code for setting up the UI - focus on the What, not on the How
* Struct based, with a set it and forget it manager object
* Setters/getters for properties
* Fluent interface (i.e. you can chain methods together)
* Kenney's amazing UI asset pack sprites are included for testing
* Text based on JujuAdams's superb Scribble renderer
* Free and open source (FOSS) (MIT license)

**gooey** currently supports the following widgets natively:

* Panels (the containers for everything else)
* Groups  (to group stuff together)
* Grids (to layout stuff in Panels or Groups)
* Buttons
* Canvases (surfaces)
* Checkboxes
* Dropdowns
* Option Groups
* Progress Bars
* Sliders
* Sprites
* Tabs (tabbed Panels)
