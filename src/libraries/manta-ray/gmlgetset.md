**GMLGetSet** is a free, tiny Windows tool for generating getters and setters for your constructor variables.

This tool reads a list of constructor assignments and generates GML code for getter and setter stubs for each field. Once copied you can paste it into your project and customize away (improve the JSDoc, modify data types, add validations or whatever is needed).

GMLGetSet can also automatically generate [GMLDocMaker](https://manta-ray.itch.io/gmldocmaker) compatible JSDoc stubs for your getters/setters.
