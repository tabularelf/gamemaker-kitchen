This was my submission for the **GameMaker Kitchen Cookbook Jam #2**.

Current features include:

*Transform a linear path into a Catmull-Rom curve (smoothly passes through all control points)
*Transform a linear path into a Bezier curve (higher control with curve handles, can combine sharp and smooth corners)
*Add extra variables to a point
*Bake the resulting curve into a path asset or export it as a .yy to use in your projects

Implemented examples include:

*A lasso tool that allows you to select instances or arrays of coordinates.
*A recorder that creates a path from your mouse movement, storing the relative speeds.
A (rough) path editor.
*Other possibilities include:

Alter path-finding curves to be more varied or smooth.
Please notice PathPlus is still a work in progress 🙂
