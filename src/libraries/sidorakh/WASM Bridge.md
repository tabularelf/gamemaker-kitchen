You ever wanted to use Javascript extensions on GX.Games?
Well.. you can't.. But, you *can* use them in local GX.Games builds, as well as zip exports of the GX Games/WASM target that'll hopefully be officially available soon

This extension allows you to expose custom JavaScript code so you can implement things such as access to native web API's, such as the vibration and web share API's, and can also be used to allow access to the Discord Activity SDK as well, for example
