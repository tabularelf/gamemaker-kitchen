I created a python tool that allows you to batch import images into GameMaker and automatically convert these to sprites or sprite sheets.

Features:
Batch Import: Import multiple GIFs/PNGs into GameMaker.
Sprite Sheets: Convert GIFs to sprite sheets automatically.
Customization: Set sprite origins, sizes, and naming conventions.
Auto updates .yyp project file on import.
Overwrite sprite width and height (absolute size)
Overwrite sprite origin -> absolute x and y or relative origin: Top Centre, Top Right, Middle Centre, Bottom Right
